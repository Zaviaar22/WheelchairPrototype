This code was used for a project completed in my Engineering Design 1 course, which was done collaboratively in a group of 5.
My role in this project was to develop a functional C++ code which we uploaded to the arduino which would allow our mechanical wheelchair prototype to move and complete obstacle challenges, and also launch a ball.
